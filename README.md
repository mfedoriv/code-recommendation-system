# Code Recommendation System
Sublime Text 3 plugin which allows you to get examples of how to use C functions with one press of the shortcut.

### Installation
1. Copy coderec.py file in Sublime Text 3 plugins directory:
    - If you're using **Windows** run *copy_coderec.***bat****.
    - If you're using **Linux** run *copy_coderec.***sh****
2. To add shortcut:
    1. Go to Preferences &#8594;Key bindings.
    2. In the file on the right *Default (...).sublime-keymap â€“ User* add the following line: `{ "keys": ["alt+shift+c"], "command": "coderecsys" }`
3. To search on Stackoverflow (and pass all tests to build project to JAR in Maven) you must be registered on this site and get a token. The token is needed by the application to authenticate on the site (more details can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication">StackOverflow Authentification</a>).
    To get a token you need to click on the link below: <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/oauth/dialog?client_id=17978&scope=no_expiry&redirect_uri=https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success">Get your Access Token</a>.
    After the transition you should press the "Approve" button, then you will be passed to the page with <b>access_token</b> in URL parameters. For example:
    
    `https://stackexchange.com/oauth/login_success#access_token=wGg8hTyBJMs8jT*PI*PLtA))`
    
    In this example, the token is `wGgg8hTyBJMs8jT*PI*PLtA))` (it's not valid).</p>
    Go to directory /src/main/resources, open file coderec.properties and place your token after "token" parameter. Like that: `token=wGg8hTyBJMs8jT*PI*PLtA))`
#### Create a JAR-file of the server
In directory with *pom.xml* run `mvn clean install`

### Using
1. Run the server from the **/target** folder with command: `java -jar code-recommendation-system-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. Running the server is **REQUIRED** to use the plugin - without it, nothing will work. To stop server press `Ctrl+C` in terminal window.
2. In **Browser**:
    1. You can check the server status by going to the address in the browser [http://localhost:8080/status](http://localhost:8080/status).
    2. You can configure the server and select the sites to be searched on by going to the address in the browser [http://localhost:8080/settings](http://localhost:8080/settings).  Note: to search on StackOverflow you need access_token! Information about how to get it can be found on the Settings page.
    3. You can search for examples of using the functions in your browser by going to [http://localhost:8080/search](http://localhost:8080/search).
    4. To get the result as JSON go to the address [http://localhost:8080/getcode](http://localhost:8080/getcode) and send the name of the C function in the **func** parameter. For example [http://localhost:8080/getcode?func=fopen](http://localhost:8080/getcode?func=fopen)
3. In **Sublime Text 3**:
    1. Place your cursor on the name of the C function;
    2. Press `Alt+Shift+C`
    3. In a few seconds a pop-up window will show examples of using the function.
    4. To copy the required example, press the **Copy** button below it (the code will be copied to the clipboard), and then paste with the `Ctrl+V` key combination where you want.
